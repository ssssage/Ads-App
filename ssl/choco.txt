With PowerShell, you must ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not Restricted. We suggest using Bypass to bypass the policy to get things installed or AllSigned for quite a bit more security.

Run Get-ExecutionPolicy. If it returns Restricted, then run Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned or Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process.
Now run the following command:

>
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
Paste the copied text into your shell and press Enter. 
After installing Chocolately 

choco install mkcert
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost

The certificate is at "./localhost.pem" and the key at "./localhost-key.pem"

inside the angular.json in serve section, below the builder provide options

 "sslKey": "ssl/localhost.key",
"sslCert": "ssl/localhost-key.pem",

or

"serve": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server",
          "options": {
            "browserTarget": "MyApp:build",
            //"sslKey": "ssl/server.key",
            //"sslCert": "ssl/server.crt",
            "sslCert": "ssl/localhost.pem",
            "sslKey": "ssl/localhost-key.pem",
            "ssl": true
          },
